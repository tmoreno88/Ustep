# Ustep
First steps of my new web project for dj's streaming.

I'm using laravel framework, with its utilities Eloquent and Blade.

This web is in progress, soon i'm gonna uptdate it with interface view, only index, and next step should be a view wich includes 
DJ's categories and most visited.

No restrictions to colaborate.

UPDATE 23/12/15

It's done, we have index inteface.

Now, in order to explain the final purposes, we need to create a database which will contains our djs, and we must categorized them in music style and how many people had visited him (not real dates).

Furthermore, users must have their database space to register, simple login into our web.

Index view should be redesign to show general list of djs and users could find them searching.

I'm learning now how to add this functionality with laravel.

SECOND UPDATE 23/12/15

In last commit, i've percived that regitered users some of them will be DJ's, so... we need create one more table that references the initial users table just for login an navigation.

Just remember that DJs table is like products to show.
